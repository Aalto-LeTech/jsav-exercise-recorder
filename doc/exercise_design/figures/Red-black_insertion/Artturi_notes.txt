Artturi would like to edit the pseudocode:

2.1 If u is root, make it black and the algorithm ends.
2.2 If u's parent t is black, the algorithm ends.
2.3 If both u and its parent t are red:
2.3.1 [change colors] If t and its sibling v are red:
Color t and v black and their parent p red.
Continue color change with p and its sibling, if necessary.
2.3.2 [rotation] If t is red and its sibling v is black:
Perform a rotation at t's parent p.
p and its new parent exchange their colors.

Step 2.3 should be explicit in the model answer.
Nodes u and t should be in italics or bolded.

Puzzling narration: chain of two red nodes under a black node.
First, line 1 talks about u as the new node.
Then, line 2.3.2 talk about t and v without reminding that t is u's parent and v is t's sibling. The student also has to remember that an empty node is always black.
The model answer would benefit from highlighting u, t, v, and p when possible.
Can JSAV position text along the nodes? Yes! http://jsav.io/otherapis/label/

On a full HD screen (1920x1080), the model answer is so wide that it partially hides the
pseudocode.
