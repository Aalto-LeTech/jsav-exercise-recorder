## Initial state

Reproducibility Requirement 1 (RR1):
The input must be included in the recording, or a unique, unambiguous
input can be deduced from the steps in the recording.

This is the first object in the outermost JSON list. Example:

```json
[{"dummy":"fixme"}]
```

Single rotation only contains a dummy placeholder, and as such, there is no data. 

RR1 not satisfied.

## Intermediate states

RR2. All the steps in the recording must have a unique, unambiguous inter-
pretation on student’s choices such that it is clear on which step the student’s
steps begin to differ from the execution path of the correct algorithm.


## End state

RR2 not satisfied.
