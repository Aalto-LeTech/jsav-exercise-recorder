Grade button click process
==========================


What happens in the Exercise Recorder when the user clicks Grade button?

The following line numbers refer to jsav-exercise-recorder-bundle.js.

935: passEvent(eventData): case 'jsav-exercise-grade-button'
     -> break

828: setTimeout: passEvent(eventData), 50

939: passEvent(eventData): case 'jsav-exercise-grade':
943: call finish(eventData)

966: finish(eventData): else {
     calls modelAnswer.progress(), which is on line 745:
         function modelAnswerProgress()
     This function just reports the step number of the model answer.

968 calls setTimeout: passEvent(eventData), modelAnswer.recordingSpeed()

922: passEvent(eventData): case 'jsav-exercise-model-forward'
     Where is this JSAV event triggered? Line 923?
     $('.jsavmodelanswer .jsavforward').click();


     Certainly the comment on line 919 "User views the animation..."
     is not totally true, as this seems to be triggered automatically
     when submitting the exercise.
